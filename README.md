## Introduction to PSUEats

- PSUEats is a food ordering and pickup platform designed to streamline the food-ordering experience within PSU community. The platform allows users to browse menus, add items to their carts, and place orders for pickup from a variety of restaurants. With a focus on security and personalization, PSUEats ensures that each user's data—such as cart contents and order history—is stored securely, while shop owners can manage their menus and track orders easily. With an Admin Dashboard to monitor users and shop owners and to download a report about the analysis. This project is developed for SE499 Senior Project by 5 female students at Prince Sultan University. By using this PSUEats website, the struggle, waist of time, and missing classes decreases.

## Agile Scrum Framework in PSUEats Development

- The development of PSUEats follows the Agile Scrum framework, a methodology that promotes adaptability and continuous improvement. Using Scrum allows the PSUEats team to work collaboratively through iterative sprints, focusing on incremental product enhancements. Each sprint includes essential processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives, ensuring transparency, quick feedback cycles, and a user-centered approach to development.

- By embracing Agile Scrum, the PSUEats team efficiently addresses evolving requirements, maintains a high level of quality in each release, and ensures that the platform meets the needs of both end-users and restaurant owners alike. This approach fosters continuous delivery, adaptability to user feedback, and an efficient response to changing requirements, allowing the project to grow dynamically.

## Key Technologies and Packages in PSUEats Development

To ensure robust and efficient development, the PSUEats team used various technologies and packages across frontend and backend development, including:

- Node.js: For backend development, allowing efficient, event-driven server-side scripting.
  Express.js: Simplifies routing and middleware integration in Node.js, crucial for creating RESTful APIs.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database chosen for its scalability and flexibility, ideal for storing user, order, and restaurant data in document format.

- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB that facilitates schema-based data modeling, validation, and relationship handling.

- EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates): Enables dynamic content rendering on the server side, particularly for the Shop Owner Dashboard.

- bcrypt.js: Provides password hashing for secure user account management.

- nodemon: Streamlines development by automatically restarting the server after changes are detected.

- path: A Node.js core module that simplifies handling and working with file and directory paths, important for setting up views and static files.

- express-session & connect-mongo: Used together to manage sessions, with connect-mongo allowing sessions to be stored in MongoDB, which supports scalability and persistence of user sessions.

- multer: A middleware for handling file uploads, used for uploading images for menus, profiles, and other media.

- Stripe: Integrated for secure, real-time payment processing, allowing PSUEats to handle transactions directly on the platform.

These packages, along with the Agile Scrum framework, have enabled PSUEats to evolve incrementally, keeping the platform user-focused, secure, and scalable. With a modular, flexible tech stack, PSUEats is well-prepared to handle future growth and feature expansions.
